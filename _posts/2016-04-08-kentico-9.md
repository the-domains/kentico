# [Kentico 9][0]

The latest release of Kentico was announced in November of 2015\.  Kentico 9 was a major release which sought to address a number of long-standing issues with the platform. The new release includes changes which empower system architects and developers with more development options, and important changes which improve development and deployment processes.

New features such as continuous integration allow developers to push smaller changes live more frequently, speeding up the development process and shortening the time it takes to deliver changes for their client.

The new campaign management features further strengthen Kentico's marketing features. Marketers can create, manage, and evaluate campaigns without overly complex tools, respecting the principles of modern user experience, and for a fraction of the cost.  The new release has also improved data visualisation and reporting.
